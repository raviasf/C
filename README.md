# C
C exercise to begin with-
Learn C — A Structured Path from Basics to Mastery

**C** is a carefully curated repository designed to document my complete learning journey in **C programming** — from writing my first `printf()` to building complex, memory-aware programs.  

This project serves two purposes:  
1. 📘 A **step-by-step learning guide** for beginners exploring C.  
2. ⚙️ A **collaborative improvement platform** for experts to review, refine, and optimize code.

Every solution in this repository is written, tested, and documented with **clarity, scalability, and collaboration** in mind.
It reflects how I approach learning, documentation, and professional software development.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a **comprehensive, beginner-friendly roadmap** to learning C through practical problems, while maintaining a codebase that meets professional standards of:
> Readability  
> Modularity  
> Logical clarity  
> Performance  

---
This repository is not a “notes dump” — it’s a **learning framework** built like production code.
---


Each solution file follows a consistent and documented pattern:

```c
// Problem: Explain what’s being solved
// Level: 01
// Description: Concept or learning focus
// Author: Ravindra

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Implementation
    return 0;
}


🏗️ Level System
Level	Focus	Description
Level 01	Foundation Straightforward, beginner-friendly implementation
Level 02	Refinement Optimized and readable version
Level 03
Level 04... 
Level EXP	Expert Review	Community-reviewed, bias-free, and production-grade logic

Every problem evolves through these levels as contributors propose improvements.

📚 Learning Roadmap
Stage	Concept	Topics Covered
01	Basics	Data types, I/O, syntax
02	Control Flow	Loops, conditionals, branching
03	Functions	Recursion, modular design
04	Pointers	Memory, arrays, dynamic allocation
05	Data Structures	Structs, linked lists
06	Advanced	File handling, command-line args

Each stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring a logical and sequential learning experience.
